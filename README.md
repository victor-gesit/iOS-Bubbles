#### Description
Following the tutorial [here](https://www.jackrabbitmobile.com/app-development/ios-bubble-animation-tutorial/), I created an animation of a fish swimming across the screen, while bubbles are released from its open mouth.

The original tutorial was written in Objective-C. This repo reproduces the tutorial, but in Swift.
